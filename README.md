This is a tiny (and not close to finished) interpreter for a RPN homoiconic S-Expression language. It's obviously inspired by lisps, although it's not one itself, and I don't really know enough about lisps to be inspired by anything more than their surface features. The homoiconicity is mostly an implementation detail right now, I need to provide functions in the builtins for manipulating the S-Expressions to make it effect the experience of writing the language. There is currently no type system (beside Atom / List / Nil), not even a dynamic one, and it's effectively stringly typed (the builtins / intrinsics that care about the form of their arguments just convert to and from strings and throw an error if not possible); this is unlikely to change

It's in Rust because I compulsively type `cargo new` when I want to start a new project. It probably should have been in Haskell since I'm doing a whole bunch of manual Rc cloning that wouldn't have been needed, and I would like to get better at Haskell anyway. As it stands I'm not doing a lot of mutation, and I could have very easily made the entire thing immutable
